GC Testing

a) root is never collected anyways, okay to have it "wait" as timer.

1) root creates N local and M remote childrenOne which are the first set.  Then waits for a certain amount of time.
    
2) each of the childrenOne (should not be collected yet because known by root) create a set of their own children, childrentwo.  

3)   

if local gc, do not add acq or invacq which are non-local
