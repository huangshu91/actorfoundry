4- Optimize the scheduler: Dynamically expanding WorkerThread pool
		and locality (affinity)
5- Re-enable Service threads (BEWARE of consequences).

6- Remove warnings and PRAGMA annotations
# 8- Fix Kilim's handling of null-initialized local variables.

12- Introduce generics types for ActorName. After compiler?
13- Replace apt tool with javac. Solved after compiler?
14- Use annotations to declare an actor instead of inheriting from Actor.

17- An example for catching exception thrown when a matching method is not found
18- Lighter actors: Remove scheduler from Task
18.5- call-specific PauseReason, reduce # of Empty_MbReason instances 
19- Taking care of the messages in in, out, err actors before termination.
20- Get rid of other undesirable conventions: one actor per source file, 
21- Creating actor inside a constructor throws an exception
22- Non-package directories in src/ produce this error:
[javadoc] javadoc: warning - No source files for package main.java.com.mycompa
ny.myapp.concurrent.actorfoundry

22- Timer service (asynchronous call(), others)

Compiler-related tasks
C3- Simple syntax for declaring actor, message, and creation of actor.
C4- Integrate check_local_sync and codegen as part of compiler.
C5- Type check messages.
C6- Support for anonymous/ad-hoc actors.
C7- 'reply' keyword that translates to 'return' (only in messages)
now with obvious semantics.
C8- Translate message sends into method calls if the locality and
availability checks are true. This could really boost the performance
of Threadring. 
C9- Simple syntax for join expressions.
